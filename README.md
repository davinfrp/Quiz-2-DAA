## Super Speed Shopping Solution
### Application Overview
  
Super Speed Shopping Solution (SSSS) is a Python-based desktop application designed to optimize the grocery shopping experience by generating the most efficient route through a supermarket. Leveraging the power of graph-based search algorithms and a user-friendly Tkinter GUI, this tool guides users from entrance to exit while picking up every item on their grocery list in the shortest possible path. 

### Application Implementation

Here are the key features of our application.
* **Interactive GUI**: Built with Tkinter, the application provides an intuitive interface with an attractive layout and visuals representing the supermarket.
* **Product Search & Selection**: Users can search for items via search bar, then add selected items to their shopping list.
* **Efficient Route Generation**: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS), the application computes the shortest route to pick up all selected items, starting from the entrance and ending at the cashier.
* **Step-by-Step Navigation**: A step-wise visual navigation system allows users to follow the shopping route one step at a time through animated map updates.
* **Visual Floor Map**: The supermarket layout is represented as a 12x12 grid, where each node corresponds to a location (e.g., rack, aisle, intersection). Each step of the path is visualized with context-aware tiles.
* **Category-Based Legend**: A legend helps users identify item categories and sections, such as "Beverages," "Toiletries," or "Snacks."
* **Checklist Panel**: As users progress, a dynamic checklist updates the items already visited and provides clarity on remaining goals.
